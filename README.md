As a UT student, there are a plethora of courses to choose from (over 10k!!). UT has a great public site for browsing all courses, but they're siloed by course prefix (ex: CS, HIS, etc). So I made a scraper put every single course into a single csv file.

If you only want the output, you can find it in [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LL_OQ3FLu-0Macn3ZkCckXinwkEc6Dw68TA1helN_aY/edit?usp=sharing).
